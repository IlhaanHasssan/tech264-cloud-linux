# **Monolith vs Two-Tier Architecture**
### ***Monolith***
- User unterface --> business logic --> data access layer --> database
- Everything was on one machine,even the database was not seperate
#### ***Pros:***
- Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, and deploy since everything is in one place.
- Tighter Integration: All components are tightly coupled, reducing the complexity of communication between different parts.
- Lower Latency: No need for inter-process communication over a network, which can reduce latency.
- Faster Development: Quick development cycle for small applications since there’s no need to manage separate services or layers.
- Simple Deployment: Deploying a single unit is straightforward without managing separate servers or services.
#### ***Cons:***
- Scalability Issues: Scaling requires replicating the entire application, not just specific parts. This can lead to inefficiency.
- Limited Flexibility: Tightly coupled components make it harder to introduce changes or add new technologies without impacting the entire system.
- Long Build and Test Cycles: As the application grows, building, testing, and deploying can become slow and cumbersome.
- Harder to Maintain: A large monolith can become difficult to manage, with code dependencies potentially leading to tight coupling and technical debt.
- Risk of System Failure: A failure in one part of the application can take down the entire system.

### ***Two-tier***
App tier and Database tier run on seperate machines.
#### ***Pros:***
- Separation of Concerns: The client and server are decoupled, making it easier to manage and scale each independently.
- Better Performance: The client can handle UI and local logic, reducing the load on the server.
- Scalability: The server tier can be independently scaled to handle more traffic or data, without affecting the client tier.
- Flexibility: Different types of clients (desktop, mobile, web) can connect to the same server logic.
- Improved Maintenance: Changes to one tier don’t always impact the other, simplifying updates.
##### ***Cons:***
- Complex Communication: Additional complexity in communication between the client and server layers, often requiring an API.
- Increased Latency: The client-server interaction can introduce network latency compared to a monolithic approach.
- Data Synchronization: More complex data synchronization between client and server, especially for distributed or offline applications.
- Security Concerns: Client-side logic might be exposed, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- Dependency Management: More effort required to keep both tiers in sync during development and deployment.
